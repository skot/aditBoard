The aditBoard is a USB adapter for Bitmain hashboards. It's based on the RaspberryPi RP2040. All of the hashboard functions (especially mining) can be utilized over USB. AditBoard will work with a PC, laptop, Raspberry Pi, or new controlboards like the [LibreBoard](libreboard.org) from [The 256 Foundation](https://256foundation.org)
